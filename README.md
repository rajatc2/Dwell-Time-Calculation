# Dwell-Time-Calculation

This project calculates the dwell time of ions or biomolecules inside a nanopore between defined points (z1 and z2) using Tcl scripting within the Virtual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) environment. This analysis provides insights into the duration ions or biomolecules spend within specific regions of the pore, which is useful for studying transport phenomena in nanopore systems.

## Features
- **Dwell Time Calculation**: Tracks and calculates the time ions or biomolecules spend between specified coordinates (z1 and z2) inside a nanopore (can be used for any device structure)
- **Tcl Scripting for VMD**: Utilizes Tcl scripts for direct integration with VMD, facilitating molecular dynamics (MD) analysis.

## Requirements
- **Virtual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)**: Ensure VMD is installed, as this project relies on VMDâ€™s simulation environment.
- **Tcl Language**: The calculations are performed using Tcl scripts compatible with VMD.

## Usage
1. Load the Tcl script in VMD.
2. Set the coordinates (z1 and z2) based on the region of interest within the nanopore.
3. Run the script to compute dwell time for ions/biomolecules.
